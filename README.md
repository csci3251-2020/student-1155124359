# My Self Introduction

__Hello my friends on Git!__, my name is WANG Ruijie. I am from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

__My experience as a developer is quite fun__. I started to obtain interest of Coding since young, and was so glad to be admitted to CS department of CU. I expect to achieve a lot of interesting goals using coding tools.

For now, I want to:

 * [x] Learn to code simple programs using C.
 * [x] Learn to code with OOP language such as Java.
 * [x] Learn to set config of a server and load some interesting programs.
 * [ ] Find an internship related to CS.
 * [ ] Take part in a CU summer research.

Yeah, and Github is really fun for me as well. It is cool to have such a version control tool that is so user-friendly.

And from my point, CU is quite a relaxing and charming place for studying.

Here is a short table for your convenience.
